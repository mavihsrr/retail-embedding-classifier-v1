# üõçÔ∏è Retail Embedding Classifier v1

This repository contains the script used to fine-tune the `retail-embedding-classifier-v1`, a specialized model optimized for generating embeddings for retail-specific tasks. 

The fine-tuned model is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mavihsrr/retail-embedding-classifier-v1).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Product Similarity Matching**
- **Taxonomy Conversion**
- **Inventory Migration**
- **Grouping Similar Products**
- **Recommendation Systems**

---
- **Fine-Tuned for Retail**: Trained on 217,894 samples of retail-specific product descriptions and related metadata.
- **Embeddings for Retail-Specific Tasks**: Generates high-quality, 768-dimensional embeddings.
- **Supports Multi-Tier Retail Use Cases**: From similarity searches to classification and clustering.
- **Efficient Inference**: Built on `BAAI/bge-base-en`, leveraging the `CosineSimilarityLoss` function for robust semantic textual similarity.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install the required library:
```pip install -U sentence-transformers```

Load the model and get started:
```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
# Load the model
model = SentenceTransformer("mavihsrr/retail-embedding-classifier-v1")
# Example inputs
sentences = [
    "Organic Almond Butter - Creamy and Unsalted. High in Protein!",
    "Peanut Butter - All Natural, Unsalted, Smooth and Creamy.",
]
# Generate embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
# Print shape of embeddings
print(embeddings.shape)  # Output: (2, 768)
```

## üìä Training Details
- Base Model: BAAI/bge-base-en
- Loss Function: CosineSimilarityLoss
- Dataset: 217,894 training samples, focusing on retail-specific texts.
- Evaluation: 21,759 evaluation samples, achieving consistent high similarity scores.

## üí° Use Cases
1. Product Similarity Matching
Find products similar to a given item based on their embeddings:
```
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)
print(similarity_matrix)
```
2. Taxonomy Conversion
Easily map products from one taxonomy to another using vector similarity.

3. Recommendations
Build recommendation systems by clustering or ranking products based on embedding similarity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration : Prepare Your Dataset
- Dataset Format: A .csv file with the following columns:
- sentence1: First text input.
- sentence2: Second text input (optional for single-sentence embeddings).
- label: Similarity score (range: 0 to 1).
Check out the official sentence-transformer [documentation](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/dataset_overview.html) for further reference.
